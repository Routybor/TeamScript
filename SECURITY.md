If you discover a security issue in our project, please let us know right away. We take security seriously and will do our best to address the issue promptly.

Please follow the responsible disclosure process:

2. Contact us directly via email at [teamscriptproj@gmail.com](mailto:teamscriptproj@gmail.com).

3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including any necessary reproduction steps or code examples.

4. Allow us reasonable time to assess and address the issue. We will keep you informed of our progress and notify you when the issue is resolved.

5. Once the issue is resolved, we will acknowledge your contribution and, if appropriate, provide credit for your responsible disclosure.
