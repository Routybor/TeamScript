**Project vision. (TeamScript)✨***

### Idea of the project:

Our goal is to create an editor that enables teamwork, project management, and project status monitoring. *Moreover, it allows people to work on the project at the same time.*

Why is this important?

### Realization:

For the convenience of development, it was decided to divide frontend and backend into two different components.

Frontend will be written in (JavaScript), backend in (Java/Python) (maybe something else).

### Features:

Main and most difficult goal for us is to allow users to use our product together. To implement that we will need to use functional DB and to create account

system.

Also, we want to add a few useful features.

- Checking current status of every subproject.
- Prioritizing tasks will help users to choose how relevant is the specific task at this moment.
- Creating subtasks’ features will provide users to track big task progress more detailed.
- *The participants of one project can use our service simultaneously, for example, make changes, add tasks.*

The number of features that can be added to such a project is large. Therefore, as we develop, we will implement more and more features.
